SITEMAP DIAGNOSIS FINAL REPORT
==============================

Date: 2025-09-01
Time: 07:40 UTC

ISSUE FOUND & FIXED
==================
Google Search Console reported "Couldn't fetch" for /api/sitemap.xml
Root cause: Legacy sitemap URL was being submitted incorrectly

FIXES IMPLEMENTED
================

1. ‚úÖ app/robots.ts - Updated to canonical domain
   - Host: https://www.wedecorevents.com (was: https://wedecorevents.com)
   - Sitemap: https://www.wedecorevents.com/sitemap.xml (was: multiple sitemaps)
   - Removed: image-sitemap reference

2. ‚úÖ app/sitemap.ts - Normalized for deterministic canonical URLs
   - All URLs now use: https://www.wedecorevents.com/ (with www)
   - Removed file system scanning for deterministic generation
   - Uses AREAS data for consistent location/area page generation

3. ‚úÖ next.config.js - Safety redirect already present
   - /api/sitemap.xml ‚Üí /sitemap.xml (308 permanent redirect)

4. ‚úÖ scripts/verify-sitemap.ts - Added comprehensive verifier
   - Checks: status 200, XML content-type, valid XML structure
   - Validates: canonical URLs, redirect safety, URL count limits
   - HEAD tests: first 20 URLs for accessibility

VERIFICATION RESULTS
===================

LIVE PRODUCTION (Current - needs deployment):
‚úì /sitemap.xml returns 200 with application/xml
‚úì /api/sitemap.xml redirects 308 ‚Üí /sitemap.xml ‚Üí 200
‚úó URLs still use https://wedecorevents.com (no www) - 67 URLs
‚úó robots.txt still references old format
‚úó All URLs return 308 (redirect to www) - expected until deploy

LOCAL BUILD (After our changes):
‚úì /sitemap.xml returns 200 with application/xml
‚úì /api/sitemap.xml redirects 308 ‚Üí /sitemap.xml ‚Üí 200  
‚úì URLs use https://www.wedecorevents.com (canonical with www) - 68 URLs
‚úì robots.txt points to canonical sitemap only
‚úì All URLs return 200 (no redirects needed)

DEPLOYMENT STATUS
================
‚ö†Ô∏è  Changes committed but deployment failed due to network issues
‚úÖ Local build and test successful - changes verified working
üìã Next: Re-deploy to production

POST-DEPLOYMENT ACTIONS
=======================
1. Re-run: npm run verify:sitemap (should show all ‚úì)
2. Google Search Console:
   - Remove: https://www.wedecorevents.com/api/sitemap.xml
   - Submit: https://www.wedecorevents.com/sitemap.xml
   - URL Inspect: Request indexing for / and key /areas/* pages
