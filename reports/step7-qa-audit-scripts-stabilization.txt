STEP 7 VERIFICATION: QA/Audit Scripts Stabilization
==================================================

✅ COMPLETED: Stabilized QA/audit scripts with tsx and centralized environment access

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
--------------------

1. ✅ Package.json Scripts Updated:
   - Replaced all ts-node commands with tsx
   - Removed complex compiler options (--compiler-options)
   - Simplified script commands for better reliability
   - All audit scripts now use consistent tsx execution

2. ✅ Environment Configuration Centralized:
   - Updated audit-env.ts to use lib/env.ts
   - Uses centralized SITE_URL from lib/site.ts
   - Proper TypeScript imports and type safety
   - Consistent environment variable access

3. ✅ Report Output System:
   - Created ./reports/ directory for all audit outputs
   - audit-env.ts generates JSON reports with timestamps
   - Structured report format with summary and detailed results
   - Reports saved to reports/audit-env-report.json

4. ✅ Script Testing Results:
   - npm run audit:env: ✅ PASSED (4/4 checks)
   - npm run audit:seo: ✅ WORKING (found 94 issues as expected)
   - tsx execution: ✅ STABLE (no more "Unknown file extension" errors)
   - Report generation: ✅ WORKING (JSON output created)

UPDATED SCRIPTS:
----------------
Audit Scripts (now using tsx):
- audit:links
- predeploy:validate
- audit:env
- audit:vercel
- audit:seo

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
- package.json: Updated all ts-node scripts to use tsx
- scripts/audit-env.ts: Updated to use lib/env.ts and generate reports
- reports/: Created directory for audit outputs
- reports/audit-env-report.json: Sample report output

COMMIT: feat(audit): stabilize QA scripts with tsx and add report output to ./reports/

BENEFITS:
---------
- ✅ No more "Unknown file extension .ts" errors
- ✅ Faster script execution with tsx
- ✅ Centralized environment configuration
