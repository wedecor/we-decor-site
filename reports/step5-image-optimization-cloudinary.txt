STEP 5 VERIFICATION: Image Optimization via Cloudinary Transformations
=====================================================================

✅ COMPLETED: Added centralized image optimization utilities with Cloudinary transformations

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
--------------------

1. ✅ Image Optimization Library Created:
   - lib/image.ts: Comprehensive image optimization utilities
   - buildCloudinaryUrl(): Core function with f_auto/q_auto transformations
   - Specialized helpers: galleryThumbnail(), heroImage(), avatarImage(), serviceCardImage()
   - Responsive image support with srcSet generation
   - Lazy loading optimization with blur effects

2. ✅ Gallery Component Updated:
   - Imported image optimization utilities
   - Updated image rendering to use optimizeImageUrl()
   - Applied f_auto/q_auto transformations to all gallery images
   - Maintained responsive design and lazy loading

3. ✅ Live Page Verification:
   - Gallery page loads successfully ✓
   - Cloudinary URLs are being used ✓
   - Images display correctly with optimization ✓
   - Responsive image loading working ✓

4. ✅ Optimization Features:
   - Automatic format selection (f_auto)
   - Automatic quality optimization (q_auto)
   - Responsive image sizing
   - Lazy loading with blur placeholders
   - Face detection for avatar images
   - Visual effects support (blur, brightness, contrast)

FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
- lib/image.ts: Created comprehensive image optimization library
- components/Gallery.tsx: Updated to use optimized image URLs

COMMIT: feat(images): add Cloudinary optimization utilities with f_auto/q_auto transformations

PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
--------------------
- Automatic WebP/AVIF format delivery for modern browsers
- Optimized quality settings reduce file sizes
- Responsive images reduce bandwidth usage
- Lazy loading improves initial page load
- Cloudinary CDN provides global edge caching

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
