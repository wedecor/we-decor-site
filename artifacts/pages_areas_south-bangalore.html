            Recently, We Decor set up a wedding reception stage in Jayanagar at a popular banquet
            hall. The design included a floral mandap, LED backdrop and themed seating that matched
            the couple’s style. Guests praised the décor for its elegance and execution. Similarly,
            in another Jayanagar project, we arranged a rooftop proposal with balloons, candles and
            a custom message board — a moment the couple will cherish forever.
